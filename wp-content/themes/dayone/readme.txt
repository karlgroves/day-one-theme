@TODO add resources here for learning about accessibility

This theme is aimed at web professionals, but is of course available and supported for anyone.

The bare essentials of a WordPress theme, no visual CSS styles added except for the CSS reset and the mandatory WP classes. 
Perfect for those who would like to build their own theme completely from scratch.

One custom menu and one widgetized sidebar to get you started.
